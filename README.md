============================

Draggables is a javascript library that allows users to exchange data between web sites using drag and drop. Its based on the HTML5 Drag and Drop and File APIs. It allows data to be exchanged between unrelated sites and between the desktop and a browser.

Having observed users connect to sites using OAuth without really understanding what exchange of data has taken place, I decided to investigate other metaphors/conventions that might be more transparent. Draggables is a series of demos that explore the use of drag and drop to directly exchange data between web sites.
